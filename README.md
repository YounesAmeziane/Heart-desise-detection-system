THIS IS A HEART DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM THAT ESTIMATES WHETHER A      
PATIENT HAS HEART DISEASE BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS OF 303     
CASES.                                                                  
                                                                      
THE MODEL USED IS LOGISTIC REGRESSION.                                  
                                                                         
THE TRAINING ACCURACY SCORE IS 85.12%, AND THE TESTING ACCURACY SCORE   
IS 81.97%, WHICH IS CONSIDERED GOOD FOR A SMALL DATASET LIKE THIS ONE.  
IN GENERAL, ACCURACY ABOVE 75% IS A SOLID RESULT IN THIS CONTEXT.
